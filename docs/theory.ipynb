    "\n",
    "In order to reduce computational cost, the MORTY PDE approach looks only at isobars and without the advection loosely coupled to depletion.\n",
    "The loose depletion coupling means that the terms in the equation can be updated as frequently or infrequently as desired. The problem can be run even without a depletion step (though it may be easier to run with depletion).\n",
    "OpenMC can generate and output the relevant production and loss rates after a depletion step, which can then be fed into the MORTY PDE solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solver uses upwind in space (backwards) and explicit in time finite differencing to generate a solution. At higher dimensions, a finite element approach would be better. The following equations show the finite difference approach.\n",
