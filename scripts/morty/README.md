# Overview
These scripts are motivated by the work of Shayan Shahbazi [1].
In general, these scripts give a high-level view of the effects of including a more refined spatial mesh on a traditional depletion simulation.

# `morty_pde_ode_compare.py`
This script offers a comparison between a depletion ODE (in time only) and a depletion PDE (1D in space and in time).

# `parallel_morty_pde.py`
This script includes an example MORTY solve for the MSRE.
