# Overview
These scripts are motivated by the work of Shayan Shahbazi [1].
In general, these scripts give a high-level view of the effects of including a more refined spatial mesh on a traditional depletion simulation.
These scripts assume the existence of two neutronicly distinct regions: in-core and ex-core.
More distinct regions can be added later.
Alternatively, different flux/power profiles can be used.
Currently, a constant flux profile is used.
